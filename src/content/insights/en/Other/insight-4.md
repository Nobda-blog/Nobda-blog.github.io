## Context 

In various scenarios, such as providing daily assistance to the elderly, aiding individuals recovering from  severe injuries, or supporting commercial and recycling tasks, one can envision a robotic assistant handling  garments by fetching, folding, and organizing clothes. In this project, we will focus on a key technical  prerequisite for realizing this challenging scenario: advancing current computer vision techniques to  enhance understanding and reasoning about the garment being manipulated. Specifically, we will address  the challenging tasks of recognizing a garment and its semantic parts in the visual content. The deep  semantic understanding of garments is particularly challenging as garment objects depict complex  topological and physical behaviors, involving strong self-occlusions and deformations of fabrics.   

## Work description 

We will ground our 2D segmentation models on paired 3D objects, considering the highly flexible, self
occluding, and nonlinear dynamics nature of the garment object. Our 3D segmentation models will leverage 
temporal information during the transition to/from the garment’s canonical form, to effectively handle the 
highly deformed state. We will proceed with the following tasks:   
1. Detection of garment types and semantic parts in canonical garments with partial occlusions, 
from 3D image input: A first step is to investigate the problem in relatively well-defined, simple 
settings: detection of garment categories and semantic part-segmentation in their canonical shapes. 
Although we will initially focus on static garments, utilizing static images, we also intend to explore 
dynamic garments in specific scenarios, using videos.  
2. Detection of garment types and semantic parts in non-canonical state with significant 
deformations and occlusions: The main challenges occur when clothes are in their non-canonical states, 
due to a high level of deformation, which induces drastic shape changes and significant self-occlusions. 
To make the problem feasible, we will assume that a single garment is depicted in the image input. Two 
different approaches are considered: One, we start with identification of a garment in its canonical shape 
and develop methodology to transfer its semantics to the non-canonical form, by estimating nonrigid 
alignment between them. Two, we develop a bending-invariant method for the detection tasks, so that 
consistent results are obtained regardless of the garment state.
