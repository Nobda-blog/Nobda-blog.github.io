title: Hyperspectral image processing development for Determining tree species, Monitoring hydric/water stress Location of Volatile Organic Components zones
description: "Diginove is a Young Innovative Company  based in Aix-en-Provence, recognized for its work in space imagery. Its TeleCense project employs earth observation technologies to assess population distribution in a given area. This information aids in census efforts, regional development planning (including water and sanitation, energy, roads, telecoms, and transport), monitoring natural areas (such as forests, crops, and rivers), and anticipating the impact of natural disasters on infrastructure and populations."

A wide range of data is utilized for the service, with the primary source being satellite observation images. These include free images from the Copernicus constellation (radar, optical) and, when higher precision is required, very high-resolution images available for a fee.

Several new satellites will be launched soon to enhance observation accuracy:

-CO3D: Provides digital surface and terrain models using stereoscopic views from four satellites.

-Trishna and LSTM: Offer VNIR, SWIR, and TIR data for surface temperature, plant evapotranspiration, crop health, etc.

-ROSE-L: Features an L-band synthetic aperture radar for observing elements below the canopy, such as land movement, soil moisture, and vegetation volume.

-CHIME: Equipped with a hyperspectral imager for environmental monitoring, precise determination of tree species, and vegetation health.

-CO2M: Uses a spectrometer operating in the near and shortwave infrared to measure carbon dioxide emissions from human activities

## Thesis objectives

These new generations of satellites will enable us to address a wide range of new applications. To prepare for their arrival, we need to:

1.Strengthen expertise in various fields of application, with the goal of developing future applications, products, and services that address societal and environmental challenges.

2.Enable rapid adoption by end-users and stakeholders of the new knowledge derived from these services, particularly in areas such as food security and agriculture, climate change adaptation (including the monitoring of forests, protected areas, urbanization, and resilience to natural disasters).

We have chosen to focus on the "forest fire" risk, which is particularly significant in our region. Our aim is to improve fire prevention by:

-Mapping crop types and tree species,

-Monitoring vegetation health, particularly water stress,

-Identifying areas with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can create explosive zones in the presence of fire.

For each of these objectives, the hyperspectral or multispectral imagers mentioned above can be utilized.


## Research methodology

The three objectives are intrinsically linked. Determining tree species is a prerequisite for both monitoring water stress and locating areas where VOCs may be present.

## Candidate profil

M2 or engineering school graduated student in applied mathematics, signal and image processing, machine learning, computer science. Some knowledge in physics will be appreciated.
