## Work Context

The main cause of mortality of sea turtles in the French West Indies is accidental capture by fishing gear, in particular bottom gillnets. The RECAPTED project aims to 1) reduce the impact of fishing on sea turtles by involving the different communities of coastal fishermen on the Martinique and Guadeloupean coasts in a process of developing innovative solutions to limit incidental catches and 2) to bring out concrete proposals to be tested in terms of fishing gear and practices.


## Constraints and risks
The experiments will take place at sea in often difficult environmental conditions and with staggered schedules, requiring teamwork with fishermen and project partners, as well as numerous trips throughout the Martinique territory. Requires a good physical condition.
