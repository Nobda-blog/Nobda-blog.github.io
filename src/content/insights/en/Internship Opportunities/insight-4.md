title: Internship - Development of a Deep Learning Calibration Method of an Adc M/F
description: "In our laboratory of 15 people, who work on the development of image sensors and the integration of algorithms, your internship will consist of developing a method for compensating for physical non-idealities (noise, dispersions, nonlinearities, etc.) of an ADC (analog-to-digital converter). The investigated method will be based on advanced Deep Learning techniques, and will have to respect the constraints of silicon integration."

## The main stages of this internship will focus on:

- Investigate the different strategies for correcting the state of the art (foreground and background calibration), and select the most relevant strategies with regard to the project specifications;
- Analyze the different sources of error associated with the different elements that make up the analog-to-digital converter;
- Produce a model of the converter integrating the different sources of non-idealities, and the correction module by associated learning;
- Evaluate the different remediation strategies and the associated implementation constraints by high-level simulation.
The work will take place mainly on PC, in the L3I premises, using the classic Deep Learning framework (mainly Keras/Tensorflow).
