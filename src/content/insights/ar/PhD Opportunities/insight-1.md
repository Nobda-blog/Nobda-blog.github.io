The Graduate School of the Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning and Data (BIFOLD) offers a strongly research-oriented qualification program. Integrated within the range of science at BIFOLD, the program is designed to implement an international, integrated PhD approach that matches and extends the BIFOLD research profile.

The program is designed to impart to the student a deep scientific understanding of the relevant systems, underlying technologies, and algorithmic skills, as well as their use in an application area. Besides their research, doctoral candidates will participate in yearly research retreats, summer/winter schools, BIFOLD seminar series, and complete coursework encompassing transferable skills, such as network building, research management, and improving communications skills, as well as technical courses in data management and machine learning (ML).
