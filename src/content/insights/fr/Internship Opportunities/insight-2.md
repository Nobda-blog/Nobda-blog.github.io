title: Internship Master 2 inorganic chemistry (M/F)
description: "Research internship Master 2 Zeolites are inorganic, microporous and crystalline materials generally composed of silicon and aluminum oxides. They can be functionalized by the addition of heteroelements, according to different methodologies. [ , ] The resulting zeolite materials have many industrial applications in catalysis, separation and adsorption processes. Oxidation reactions represent an important part of the production and decontamination processes for which heterogeneous catalysts are widely used. The project we propose aims at the synthesis, functionalization and characterization of zeolite materials with desirable properties for catalysis. These materials will be functionalized either by isomorphic substitution (insertion of heteroelement in tetrahedral sites) or by cation exchange (replacement of compensation cations, see Figure). The recruited intern will play an active role in the different aspects of the research project including the synthesis of organic structurings, the preparation of zeolites by hydrothermal means, the post-functionalization steps and the characterization of materials (XDR, SEM/EDX, TEM, nitrogen adsorption, solid state NMR). Catalytic testing will be performed collaboratively. "

## TDescription of the employer

Institute of Materials Science of Mulhouse (IS2M) / UMR 7361
Scientific Axis: Materials with Controlled Porosity (MPC)
University of Haute Alsace (Mulhouse)
This project benefits from a HiFunMat starting grant (https://hifunmat.unistra.fr/). The IS2M analytical platform provides the appropriate equipment and the trainee will be trained in the use of some of the devices. The intern will participate in the analysis, interpretation and presentation of results at meetings. Thus, he/she will benefit from a solid training in the field of inorganic chemistry, experience in a research laboratory and will be able to develop transversal skills useful in the perspective of a scientific career. The laboratory is located on the Illberg campus of the University of Haute-Alsace, 2 km from Mulhouse city centre (served by the tram).
## Description of the profile sought

Student (M/F) enrolled in a chemistry course at Master 2 level in a higher education institution in a member country of the European Union (applications that do not meet this criterion will not be considered).
The candidate (M/F) must be motivated, interested in research, willing to learn to use new techniques, ability to analyze results, think and organize work.

## Special conditions of practice

Remuneration: bonus at the hourly rate in force (€4.35 per hour in 2024 or approximately €659.76 net/month).

## Languages

French, English
