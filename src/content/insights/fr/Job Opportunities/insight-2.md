## General Information

- **Job Title**: Assistant Engineer in Formulation and Evaluation (M/F)
- **Reference**: UMR8258-CARROQ-001
- **Number of Positions**: 1
- **Workplace**: Paris 06
- **Posting Date**: Tuesday, August 27, 2024
- **Contract Type**: Technical/Administrative Fixed-Term Contract
- **Contract Duration**: 12 months
- **Expected Start Date**: October 1, 2024
- **Workload**: Full-time
- **Salary**: Between €2,325 and €2,630 gross/month, depending on experience
- **Desired Education Level**: Level 5 - (Bac+2)
- **Desired Experience**: 5 to 10 years
- **Scientific Domain**: Chemical Sciences and Material Sciences
- **Job Category**: Assistant Engineer in Material Science / Characterization

## Missions

The main objective of the work will be to prepare, optimize, and characterize nanoemulsions for the delivery of small chemical molecules for electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and imaging. The nano-formulated molecules will then be evaluated in vivo for their potential to detect oxidative stress in collaboration with the LCBPT laboratory - CNRS UMR 8601 (Laboratory of Pharmacological and Toxicological Chemistry and Biochemistry) as part of a pre-maturation project funded by CNRS Innovation.

## Activities

- Optimize and adapt nanoemulsions to the molecules synthesized by LCBPT
- Characterize the obtained formulations (DLS, zeta potential, etc.)
- Participate in cell culture evaluation
- Participate in the in vivo evaluation of selected molecules
- Write and maintain protocols
- Communicate the results obtained

## Skills

- Formulation and physico-chemical characterization
- Basic knowledge of cell culture
- Experience (level 2) in IV administration in rodents would be highly appreciated
- Precision, autonomy, and organization in task management
- Strong communication skills and ability to work in a multidisciplinary scientific team

## Work Context

The **Unit of Chemical and Biological Technologies for Health (UTCBS)** is an interdisciplinary joint research unit supported by the University of Paris, Inserm (unit 1267), and CNRS (UMR 8258). The UTCBS team focuses on innovative health technologies, particularly the development of new pharmaceutical formulations and the search for new diagnostic agents. Within UTCBS, the recruited engineer will work under the direction of Dr. Caroline Roques on the formulation of innovative probes for detecting oxidative stress by EPR. This project, resulting from a collaboration with Prof. Fabienne Peyrot (LCBPT laboratory), has led to a patent filing and is supported by pre-maturation programs from Paris Cité University and CNRS Innovation.

## Constraints and Risks

- Confined magnetic field (EPR equipment)
- Remote work is not compatible with the proposed position
