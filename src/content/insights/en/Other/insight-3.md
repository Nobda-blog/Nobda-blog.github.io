Classification and characterization of the surface condition of a pavement by integrating physical knowledge of unconventional acquisition systems

 

One of the main technological challenges for driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles is the understanding of the environment with sensors. This is what management decision-making algorithms are based on [1]. In environmental perception, most of the work currently being carried out is based on a number of sensors such as lidars, cameras and radars. Although these sensors offer reliable responses in favorable weather conditions, they struggle to respond correctly when visibility is reduced or when the scene is highly dynamic. The problem of reduced visibility conditions remains an unsolved challenge, as evidenced by the few accidents involving autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, whether with a camera (Tesla) or a LIDAR (Uber). In 2021, the National Interministerial Road Safety Observatory (ONISR) published a report in which it attests that in France, over 3 years (2018, 2019, 2021), 44% of fatal accidents among 18-34 year olds take place in foggy weather compared to 31% in normal times. Similarly, deteriorating weather (rain, fog, slippery roads, snow, hail, etc.) causes 23% of road fatalities and 20% of injuries (74,000 per year), which is not insignificant.

## Objective of the thesis:

The objective of this thesis work is to design a method for estimating the condition of the pavement that is quite reliable and capable of working in all types of degraded conditions. Initially, we will have to choose in which spectral bands to work and with which types of sensors, which lighting, with the aim of overcoming the limitations of current work, which remains few in number. In a second step, we need to design the processing that possibly combines the outputs of several sensors, for example with learning methods. The modeling of sensor uncertainties and the propagation of these uncertainties during processing will then be important to characterize the performance of the measurement system(s) studied. This work will be able to take advantage of simulation databases from the SWEET simulator of CEREMA Clermont-Ferrand which is dedicated to the modeling of road scenes. Then, the evaluations will be continued using images in degraded real conditions taken outdoors through the seasons, as planned in the framework of the ANR INARI project. The ground truth can be obtained by a multi-channel water layer thickness measurement sensor. Once the signs characterizing the surface have been studied, the classification of the different areas of the road according to their dangerousness can be carried out. The AI-based classification algorithms, which will be developed in this thesis work, will use techniques for integrating physical knowledge into networks to account for the unique characteristics offered by polarization imaging, such as the degree and angle of polarization. The classification could be done in a graduated manner, i.e. first, classifying a dry or wet pavement and then in the wet class, defining the subclasses on the road surface (water, puddle, ice, snow).

The results of this thesis work will be used to feed the implementation of an improved control for the vehicle, by another partner of the ANR INARI project.

## Required profile: 

The candidate must have a Master 2 or an engineering degree with good knowledge in image processing, computer vision, deep learning. Knowledge of mathematics, optimization techniques or physics/optics will be appreciated. The programming language is left to the choice but Python is preferred.
